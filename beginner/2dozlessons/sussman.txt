The ultimate value generated by computer scientists is
the invention of languages for describing processes ...
What computer science delivers, has delivered, and is
continuing to and will be developing in the future, are
methods of describing complicated processes such that
what used to take hundreds of pages of English text
to describe will take a few lines in a formal language.
Formal is important, because it is possible for us to
understand it, and to communicate it quickly, and for
it not to be ambiguous and perhaps for us to run it.
