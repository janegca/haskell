    your answer by evaluating the expressions with the computer.

    Exercise 2
    
    The following list comprehensions define a list of ordered pairs.
    What relations are represented by these lists? Give the domain and 
    the co-domain, as well as the pairs themselves.
    
    (a) [(a,b) | a <- [1,2],        -- domain
                 b <- [3,4]]        -- codomain

          of a relation contains only the x elements of the
          ordered pairs and the codomain, the y elements.

    Exercise 3
    
    For each of the following Digraph representations of a relation,
    draw a graph of the relation, work out whether it is reflexive and 
    whether it is irreflexive, and then check your conclusion using the 
    isReflexive and isIrreflexive functions:

    Exercise 4
    
    Determine whether each of the following relations on real numbers
    is reflexive and whether it is irreflexive. Justify your conclusions.
    
    (a) less than (<)
            irreflexive, a number cannot be less than itself and
                         equal to itself at the same time
                         
    (b) less than or equal to (<=)
            reflexive, a number can equal itself
            
    (c) greater than (>)
            irreflexive, a number can be equal to itself and 
            greater than itself at the same time
            
    (d) greater than or equal to (>=)
            reflexive, a number can always equal itself

            reflexive, a number is always equal to itself

{-
    Exercise 5

    Exercise 6

    and reflexive, but it has only the arcs required in order to be 
    reflexive. Is R symmetric?

         then the relation is symmetric.

    Exercise 7
        In the definition of a symmetric relation, can the variables x

        Why do we not need to check the ordered pairs in R while

        Why can we stop calculating powers after finding that two

        What is the relationship between adding new ordered pairs to
