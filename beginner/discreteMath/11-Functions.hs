    Functions
    
    "A function is an abstract model of computation" with the essential
    quality that the result is totally determined by the input i.e.
    no matter how often you feed the function the same input you will
    always get the same output.
    
    A function is also a 'black box'; as long as you know the form
    of the required input you can use it without knowing anything
    about how it's internals work [much like using a toaster, we
    put the bread in, wait a few minutes and out pops the toast; we
    don't have to know how the toaster is electrically wired to in 
    order to use it]
    
    Because the concept of a function is abstract there are many 
    different ways to define it.
